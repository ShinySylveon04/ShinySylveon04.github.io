# Let's Go Chaining!

One of the most notable features in Let's Go is the ability to chain Pokemon for better IVs and higher chance of encountering a shiny. Since there is no breeding this will be the only way to obtain those perfect competitive Pokemon!

## What is chaining?

For each Pokemon of a species you capture in a row, the chain for that Pokemon will increase. For best results you will want to aim for catching 40 of the same species in a row. However, do not feel daunted by that number, chaining is now easier than ever!

## What can break a chain?

- Catching another species that is not the one you are chaining. Evolutions/pre-evolutions are counted as different species for this.
- Target species running away.

That's it! 

## What will not break a chain?

- Encountering another species and running away.
- Leaving the area and returning. (Can stock back up on Pokeballs if run out!)
- Battling trainers.

## The Chain Stats

| Chain # | # of 31 IVs | Shiny Rerolls |
| 0-5 | 2 | 1 |
| 6-10 | 3 | 1 |
| 11-20 | 4 | 2 |
| 21-30 | 5 | 3 |
| 31-40+ | 6 | 4 |

The `# of 31 IVs` column refers to the possibility of catching a Pokemon with that many IVs as 31. 

However it seems after obtaining a chain of 40 all Pokemon captured have at least 4 IVs set to 31.

## Optimal Chaining

Visit Madame Celedon in Celedon City Pokecenter to set the nature you want. All Pokemon encountered afterwards will have the nature of your choosing.

Use Lures as often as possible. These increase the amount of Pokemon that spawn and really help with those hard to find Pokemon.

If using Lures move as little as possible. This is because Lures last for a certain amount of steps, so the more you move the more Lures you will use.

If you accidentally run into a different species than the one you're chaining, don't worry, running away will not break the chain.

Leaving the area to go to a Pokemart to buy more Pokeballs or Lures will not break the chain either.

When in the capture screen you can see what chain number you are on in the upper left.

## Notes

This information may change as more is discovered. The above is everything I've discovered so far while chaining for Pokemon.
